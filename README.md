Compulsory Task 2: Capstone Projects

Capstone Project 1:
For this project, I have created a finance calculator. I assume that I have been approached by a small financial company and asked to create a program that allows the user to access two different finance calculators: an investment calculator and a home loan repayment (bond) calculator.


To use the calculators, you will be prompted to answer a few questions which will initiate the calculations. The first question asks you to type either 'investment' or 'bond'. When you type investment, it commits you into using the investment calculator and bond will initiate the home loan repayment calculator. The following questions take the information the calculators need to calculate either interest earned on an investment or the amount you will pay on a home loan.

Once the calculation to your selection has been complete, the program will ask you whether you would like to start again, if you respond with a yes, the process repeats, otherwise the program ends with a closing statement: Thank you for using this calculator

Here is a picture of the output, to show an example of the program in action:
